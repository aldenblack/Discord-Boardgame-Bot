# Overview
GB is a bot to facilitate certain boardgames on Discord. Thus far it only supports the Game of Amazons, a 2-player game where the goal is to have the last move.



# How to Use
The commmands for starting a game are:

`info <game>`: Displays overview and help for a game.

`challenge <player> <game>`: Open a challenge with a new opponent.

`challenges` or `currentgames`: Display your incoming, outgoing, and ongoing games.

`accept <player> <game>`: Accept a challenge and start a new game.

Within a game, input is taken as a list of board positions as shown below.
